# Enron-Machine-Learning-Project

This is the final project of the Udacity course Introduction to Machine Learning.
In this project ML is applied to the enron dataset to identify person of interests in the fraud/ scandal of enron.

I documented my steps and answered the project questions throughout the poi_id.py file.
